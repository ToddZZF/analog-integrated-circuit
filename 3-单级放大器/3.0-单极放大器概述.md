## Applications and General Considerations

Applications of Amplifier:

1. to drive a load
2. to overcome the noise of a subsequent stage
3. to provide logical levels to a digital circuit
4. to play a role in feedback systems (Chapter 8)

Amplifier categories

|Common-Source Stage (共源)|Source Follower (源极跟随器)|Common-Gate Stage (共栅)|Cascode (共源共珊)|
|---|---|---|---|
|With Resistive Load |With Resistive Bias|With Resistive Load|Telescopic|
|With Diode-Connected Load|With Current-Source Bias|With Current-Source Load|Folded|
|With Current-Source Load|
|With Active Load|
|With Source Degeneration|

For each amplifier above, we will 

1. analyze the MOS's stage using the equation we learn at chapter 1
2. introduce the small-signal model
3. discuss how to increase the gain


An ideal amplifier: output is a linear replica of the input: $y(t)=\alpha_1 x(t)$, where $\alpha_1$ denote the gain. if we consider the bias (dc operating) point, the overall output is $y(t)=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 x(t)$

Any amplifier is a compomise (trade-off) between "analog design octagon":

In this chapter, we are going to discuss how to calculate $A_v$ and $r_o$
