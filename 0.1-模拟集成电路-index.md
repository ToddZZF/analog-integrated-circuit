## 概论

### Why Analog

* The sensing interface still demands high-performance analog design (to amplify the signal).
* At lower speeds, it is more efficient to digitize the signal and perform the required function(s) in the digital domain, whereas athigher speeds, we implement the function(s) in the analog domain.
* Sensors can only use analog design.

### Why CMOS

CMOS - complemetary metal-oxide-silicon

* The low cost of fabrication
* The possibility of placing both analog and digital circuits on the same chip so as to improve the overall performance and/or reduce the cost of packaging
* Device scaling continued to improve the speed of MOSFETs

### Analog Design Challenges

* THranistor IMperfections
* Declining Supply Voltages
* Power Consumption
* Circuit Complexity
* PVT Variations

### Levels of Abstraction
